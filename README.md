# UtilityScripts

I created this shell utility where i need to send my daily task status report to my manager which i was always forgetting, hence i created a solution.

- Created a file where i was updating my task status
- Now given that file link in shell script to send mail using this utility
- This utility sends mail only on working days (Monday to Friday) at customised time.

I hope this helps people like me. :)
